Parallel Computing using C and MPI: 

The aim of this project was to improve the efficiency of excess scaling algorithm by parallelizing it. Set up MPICH2 cluster using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS including 1 master and 4 slaves with password less SSH, NFS and NIS setup between all nodes. Implemented serial execution of the algorithm in C and parallel execution of the algorithm using MPI and carried out performance analysis using Benchmarking tools.
